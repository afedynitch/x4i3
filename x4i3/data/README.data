This folder is empty to reduce the footprint of the python wheel distributed over pip.
The first access to the database files by X4i3 initiates the download and decompression.

The binaries are available for manual download from the releases page in https://github.com/afedynitch/x4i3/releases
More support tools to recreate/update these files are located in the repository https://github.com/afedynitch/x4i3_tools

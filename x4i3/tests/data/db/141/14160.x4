FACILITY   (VDGT,1USAOHO)Experiment performed at the Ohio
            University Edwards Tandem Accelerator Laboratory
INC-SOURCE (D-T) Neutrons were produced by the 3H(d,n)4He reaction
           using a continuous beam of 460 keV deuterons directed
           onto a tritiated titanium target, which consisted of a
           tritiated titanium layer, approximately 2.0 mg/cm2
           on a 0.5 mm silver backing.
SAMPLE     Polypropylene foil with thickness of 3.8 mg/cm2
           mounted on a 0.5 mm thick tantalum backing located
           50.3 cm from the neutron-producing target.
DETECTOR   (TELES,SI,SI) The detector system was made of 11
           fixed E-dE telescopes located at 0,+-12,+-24,+-36,
           +-48 and +-60deg with respect to the neutron beam axis
           in a scattering chamber. Detector thickness at each
           angle was optimized for given proton recoil energy.
METHOD     (EDE) for proton identification
CORRECTION  Corrections for dead time and multiple scattering
            were applied
ERR-ANALYS (ERR-T) total uncertainty, essentially statistical
            They include also following contributions
           (ERR-1,0.2,0.3) Uncertainty in normalization
                   sample-in and sample-out runs
           (ERR-2) Uncertainty in determination of solid angle
           (ERR-3) Uncertainty in gate size and region of interest
                   shape
           (ERR-4) Uncertainty in corrections for multiple
                   scattering and finite size effects, calculated
                   by Monte-Carlo method

                                    was used

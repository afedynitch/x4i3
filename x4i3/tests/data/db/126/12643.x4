TITLE      NEUTRON-PROTON SCATTERING IN THE ENERGY RANGE OF 18 TO
            21 MEV
FACILITY   (CYCLO,1USAPUP)
N-SOURCE   (A-BE)
SAMPLE     POLYETHYLENE FOILS
MONITOR    (90-TH-232(N,F),,SIG)
DETECTOR   (TELES,PROPC) FOUR CYLINDRICAL PROPORTIONAL COUNTERS
            WITH LEAD SLEEVES TO REDUCE PROTONS FROM BRASS WALLS.
           (THRES) SILVER THRESHOLD DETECTORS TO MEASURE ANGULAR
            DISTRIBUTION OF NEUTRON BEAM.
METHOD     COUNTER SYSTEM FILLED WITH MIXTURE OF ARGON AND
            3-PERCENT CO(2) AT 20-CM HG PRESSURE. POLONIUM ALPHA
            SOURCE USED TO CALIBRATE GAS FILLING AND ELECTRONICS.
            2-FT THICK BY 4-FT WIDE CEMENT SHIELD USED TO PROTECT
            COUNTER TELESCOPE FROM DIRECT NEUTRON BEAM. LEAD FOIL
            1/16-INCH THICK REMOVES PROTONS PRODUCED IN SHIELD.
            TARGET THICKNESSES CHOSEN SO THAT EACH ANGLE CHOOSES
            IDENTICAL SEGMENTS OF NEUTRON SPECTRUM
ERR-ANALYS ERROR IN LOCATION OF TELESCOPE LESS THAN 0.25-DEGREE.

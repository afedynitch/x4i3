TITLE      -NEUTRON-PROTON SCATTERING IN THE ENERGY RANGE
            70 TO 170 MEV.-
FACILITY   (SYNCY,2UK HAR) HARWELL SYNCHROCYCLOTRON.
INC-SOURCE (P-BE ) PROTONS FROM SYNCHROCYCLOTRON WITH
            A MAXIMUM ENERGY OF 170 MEV IMPINGING ONTO
            A BE-TARGET OF .25 INCH THICKNESS. THE N-BEAM
            WAS CONFINED TO A DIAMETER OF 2 INCHES BY
            MEANS OF A CONCRETE SHIELDING.
INC-SPECT  .THE NEUTRON SPECTRUM RANGED FROM ABOUT 50 TO 170
            MEV, WITH A PEAK NEAR 140 MEV. A GRAPH OF THE
            SPECTRUM IS GIVEN IN FIGURE 8 OF THE MAIN
            REFERENCE.
           .THE QUANTITY 'EN-MEAN' IS A SPECTRUM AVERAGED
            ENERGY BETWEEN THE LIMITS 'EN-MIN' AND 'EN-MAX'.
            IT IS CALLED THE 'EFFECTIVE ENERGY' IN THE MAIN
            REFERENCE. THE QUANTITY 'EN-ERR' IS THE ERROR IN
            'EN-MEAN' AND ARISES FROM THE ERROR IN THE
            MEASURED SPECTRUM.
SAMPLE     .BOTH SAMPLES (POLYETHYLENE AND CARBON ) WERE
            5 INCHES LONG AN 1.5 INCHES WIDE. THEY WERE
            100-200 MICRONS THICK.
           .THE POLYETHYLENE SAMPLE WAS CUT FROM A SHEET
            OF ABOUT 100 MICRONS THICKNESS. IT CONSISTED
            OF 100 PERCENT PURE (C-H(2))(N). THE THICKNESS
            WAS 10.54 +-0.01 MG/CM**2.
           .THE CARBON SAMPLE WAS PREPARED BY DRYING OUT
            OF AQUADAG WHICH HAD BEEN DILUTED IN WATER,
            IN A METAL MOULD. REMOVAL OF THE DRY C-FILM
            WAS FACILITATED BY THE USE OF A WET SHEET OF
            CELLOPHANE TIGHTLY STRETCHED OVER THE BASE OF
            THE MOULD. ITS THICKNESS WAS 13.62 +- 0.03
            MG/CM**2 AND WAS CHOSEN SO AS TO PRODUCE THE
            SAME ENERGY LOSS AS THE POLYETHYLENE TARGET
            FILM. IT CONSISTED OF 93.4 PERCENT CARBON,
            1 PERCENT HYDROGEN AND 5.6 PERCENT OXYGEN.
METHOD     (REC  ) MEASUREMENT OF THE ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS
            OF THE RECOILING PARTICLES FROM A CARBON
            SCATTERER AND FROM A POLYETHYLENE SCATTERER.
            THE DIFFERENCE YIELDS THE AMOUNTS OF
            PROTONS RECOILING FROM HYDROGEN NUCLEI AS
            A FUNCTION OF THE RECOIL ANGLES.
            FROM THESE AMOUNTS THE HYDROGEN ELASTIC
            SCATTERING ANGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS CAN BE
            DERIVED.
            THE PROTON ANGLES ARE DETERMINED BY THE
            ANALYSIS OF THE PROTON TRACKS
            IN A PHOTOGRAPHIC EMULSION.
            THE PROTON ENERGIES ARE DETERMINED FROM
            THE RANGES OF THE PROTONS IN THIS EMULSION.
            FROM THIS PROTON ENERGY THE NEUTRON ENERGY
            CAN BE DERIVED.
DETECTOR   (TRD  ) SCATTERING CHAMBER UNDER A PRESSURE OF
            1.E-2 CM HG CONTAINING FOUR 1.5 MILLI-M THICK
            GLASS PLATES COATED WITH A 600 MICRON LAYER OF
            ILFORD C2 PHOTOGRAPHIC EMULSION AND A 25 MICRON
            SUPERCOAT OF ILFORD G5 EMULSION.
           .THE FOUR PLATES WERE HELD AT ANGLES OF 54,44,34
            AND 24 DEGREES TO THE NEUTON BEAM.
           .THE PLATES AT 44,34 AND 24 DEGEREES WERE BEHIND
            ALUMINIUM ABSORBERS DESIGNED TO BRING MOST OF
            RECOILS TO REST IN THE EMULSION. UNFORTUNATELY
            THE EFFECT OF MULTIPLE SCATTERING IN THE
            ALUMINIUM WAS TOO LARGE, AND IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE
            TO USE THE MEASUREMENTS ON THE PLATES AT 34 AND
            24 DEGREES.

            ITS VALUE AS A FUNCTION OF THE NEUTRON ENERGY
            IS USED TO DETERMINE THE INCOMING NEUTRON
            SPECTRUM. THE NUMERICAL VALUES ARE GIVEN

TITLE      -NEUTRON-PROTON SCATTERING IN THE ENERGY RANGE 70 TO
            170 MEV.-
FACILITY   (CYCLO,2UK HAR) SYNCHROCYCLOTRON.
INC-SOURCE (P-BE ) PROTRON BEAM FROM CYCLOTRON STRIKING A
            BERYLLIUM TARGET, 0.25 IN. THICK. OUTCOMING NEUTRONS
            FILTERED WITH 40 G/CM*CM POLYETHYLENE TO HAVE
            RELATIVELY MORE HIGHER ENERGY NEUTRONS.
SAMPLE     .POLYETHYLENE (PURE (C-H(2))N), SHEET OF 5 IN. LONG,
            1.5 IN. WIDE AND 10.54+-0.01 MG/CM*CM THICK.
           .CARBON TARGET PREPARED BY THE DRYING OUT OF AQUADAG,
            DILUTED WITH WATER, IN A METAL MOULD, 13.62+-0.03
            MG/CM*CM THICK, COMPOSITION 93.4 PERC. CARBON, 1 PERC
            HYDROGEN, 5-6 PERC OXYGEN+NITROGEN.
METHOD     (ASSOP) PROTON RECOIL PARTICLES MEASURED AT DIFFERENT
            ANGLES. PROTON CROSS SECTIONS DETERMINED BY MAKING
            THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MEASUREMENT ON POLYETHYLENE
            AND A MEASUREMENT ON CARBON.
DETECTOR   (PLATE) PHOTOGRAPHIC EMULSIONS. COATED ON GLASS PLATES
            OF 1.5 MM THICKNESS, 4 IN. LENGTH AND 3 IN. WIDTH, 60
            MICRON THICK ILFORD C2 WITH A SUPERCOAT OF G5
            EMULSION OF 25 MICRON THICKNESS. EXTRA PLASTICIZERS
            WERE ADDED IN ORDER TO PREVENT DISTORTION. ALUMINIUM
            ABSORBERS WERE USED IN FRONT OF THE DETECTORS TO MAKE
            THE RECOILS TO BE STOPPED WITHIN THE FILMS.
MONITOR    (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA,,SPA) AT 62.5 DEGREES. THIS
            VALUE WAS CALCULATED USING THE DATA FOR THE REACTION
            (1-H-1(N,EL)1-H-1,,DA) AT DIFFERENT ENERGIES, INTER-
            POLATED FROM 5 REFERENCES, AND THE MEASURED SHAPE OF
            THE INCOMING NEUTRON SPECTRUM.
STATUS     (NDD  ) DATA TAKEN FROM NEUDADA.
HISTORY    (800219T) G.C.
           (800222E)
CORRECTION .BACKGROUND FROM N-INDUCED STARS IN THE MATERIAL
            AROUND THE CAMERAS AND FROM COSMIC RAY PARTICLES.
            ALSO CORRECTIONS FOR ENERGY LOSS IN THE TARGET FILMS.

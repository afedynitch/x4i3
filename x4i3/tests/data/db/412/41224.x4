TITLE      Neutron elastic scattering by protons at 580 MeV energy
EXP-YEAR   (1954)
FACILITY   (SYNCY)
INC-SOURCE (P-BE)  Neutrons with max energy 600 MeV were obtained
                 at bombardment of Be-target with 680-MeV protons
INC-SPECT   Neutron beam has maximum at energy 600 MeV and
            half-width about 130 MeV. Mean energy was determined
            to be 580 MeV taking into account detector threshold.
            Neutron beam intensity at target position -
            2.E+4 neutron/cm**2/sec.
METHOD     (REC)      Recoil protons method
           (COINC)    Coincidence
DETECTOR   (TELES,SCIN,SCIN)    Counter telescope consisting of
                   three scintillation counters in coincidence.
            Detector threshold 450 MeV was ensured by tungsten and
            copper filters.
CORRECTION  For charged pi-mesons.
            For self-absorption.

ANALYSIS   Absolute values of differential cross-sections were
           determined by normalization to total elastic
           cross-section (26.0 +- 3. mb), which was defined as
           difference of total cross-section (36. +- 2. mb) from
           REL-REF(Dzhelepov+) and cross-section of pi-mesons
           production(10. +- 2. mb) at n-p interactions. Differen.
           cross-section was assumed to be about constant at
           angles   < 35 deg in CM system and was equal to value
           at 35 deg.,as it was defined in experiments at energy
           range 300-400 MeV(see REL-REF of Hartzler+ for details)
